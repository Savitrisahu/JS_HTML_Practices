    Cookies :cookies are small strings of data stored directly in the browser, used to store data 
    <script>
        // console.log(document.cookie);        //only work on browser 
        // console.log(document.cookie);                    
        // document.cookie = "name=Savitri24"            // this is a method to create and add a cookie, and it not replace all cookies just add another one
        // document.cookie = "name2=Savitri2005"           // here name and name2 is kind of variables that is must to define and cannot used same name variables
        // console.log(document.cookie);                    
        
        // let key = prompt("Enter your key : ")           // a way to get cookie name and value from user
        // let value = prompt("Enter your value : ")       // but the key or value anything we give if we add a semicolon the browser store only untill the semicolan
        // // document.cookie = `${key}=${value}`          // this is call a setcall, and there is limit of chars which is = 4kb, in below given method
        // document.cookie = `${encodeURIComponent(key)}=${encodeURIComponent(value)}`//this is the method to solve that problem, this will encode the value and key into code 
        // // decodeURI("codeGivenByBrowser")           // by running this method on browser you will get the original normal version of key and value that were user entered
        // console.log(document.cookie);

        document.cookie = "1=2;3=4"             // this will not set multiple cookies, rather than give options like if 1st one is not set than set the 2nd one, and here is 2 options for setting cookies

        // there is some limits in cookies = 
        // 1. and there is limit of chars which is = 4kb
        // 2. yo can not set more than 20 cookies  in a domain, exact numbers are browser dependent
